Flint is a high‐level, statically‐typed language designed to deliver maximum power in the most approachable way. Its core philosophy is the Data-Object Convergence Paradigm — an ECS-inspired model where data is separated from behavior and then composed deterministically into class-like entities. Every function in Flint is pure (no side effects), and functions themselves are data that can be passed around or even hot-reloaded — thanks to the Thread Stack, which eliminates the possibility of race conditions by design. Write fast, predictable code without hidden complexity.
