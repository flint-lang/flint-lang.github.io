This is the main documentation for all developers wanting to contribute to the `flintc` compiler itself. In this chapter you will (eventually) find all internal documentation of systems, subsystems, designs, algorighms and the pipeline explainations and everything else regarding the compiler itself. It is aimed to document everything regarding the compiler itself in here in the Wiki, as then it's easy to check internal documentation of past versions to check how things changed / evolved over time.

The `flintc` project is the main project for Flint, and it also contains the `fls` project as a subproject, but the documentation for the language server is done in a [separate](./fls.md) chapter.
