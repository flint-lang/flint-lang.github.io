# From Beginner To Intermediate

In this guide, you will learn all the basics of Flint. For easier chapter management, the whole journey of "From Beginner to Master" is split into three parts:
- "From Beginner to Intermediate" which handles all basics of Flint
- "From Intermediate to Expert" which goes more in depth into advanced Flint features
- "From Expert to Master" which tries to explain *everything* Flint has to offer

With each chapter, you will learn more and more about the Flint language and its inner workings. At the end of this guide, you will know absolutely everything there is to know about the Flint language. No hidden features, no "never ending learning" of the language itself. Flint is made to be finite. Thats also the reason to why Flint does not ship a built-in standard library (stl).

Flint is meant to be a language framework, which aims to be as easy as possible while being as powerful as possible. We aim to provide you with a box full of little LEGOs. At the end of this guide series, you will know every LEGO block that exists.

Flint is sometimes limited on purpose. It has no manual memory management capabilities, for example, but these limitations all serve a singular purpose: Making Flint easier and quicker to work with, but not letting it feel like magic. Every design choise of Flint has a purpose. At the end of this full guide, you will understand every single design decision we took and why it was made.

But enough talking, lets jump right into it, lets turn you into a Flint master, shall we?
