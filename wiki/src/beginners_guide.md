# From Beginner To Intermediate

In this guide, you will learn all the basics of Flint. For easier chapter management, the whole journey of "From Beginner to Master" is split into three parts. "From Beginner to Intermediate", "From Intermediate to Expert" and "From Expert to Master". With each chapter, you will learn more and more about the Flint language and its inner workings. At the end of this guide, you will know absolutely everything there is to know about the Flint language. No hidden features, no "never ending learning" of the language itself.

Flint is meant to be a language framework, which aims to be as easy as possible while being as powerful as possible. We aim to provide you with a box full of LEGOs, and at the end of this guide series, you will know every block that exists, and then your creativity is fully unhinged!

Flint is sometimes limited on purpose. It has no manual memory management capabilities, for example, but these limitations all serve a singular purpose: Making Flint easier and quicker to work with, but not letting it feel like magic. Every design choise of Flint has a purpose and at the end of this full guide, you will know every single one of them.

But enough talking, lets jump right into it, from 0 to mastery.
