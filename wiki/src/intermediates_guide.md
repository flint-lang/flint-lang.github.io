# From Intermediate to Expert

Welcome to the Intermediates guide! In this guide you will learn new and bigger concepts of Flint and also become more familiar with how Flint handles various systems and *stuff* under the hood. Being great in a language does not necessarily only mean knowing all it's syntax, but clearly understanding *what* the language does under the hood for you and then choosing the right feature for the job, based on this holistic knowledge of the language. While you will not learn **everything** that's going on under Flint's hood in this guide (Thats more for the expert's guide), you will learn quite a lot of new concepts and features which make your life using Flint much easier.

The goal of this guide is not only to teach the *how* but also the *why*, which is equally as important. Flint is open source, so the more you understand about the language itself the more you essentially understand about it's compiler, as the compiler is just a "mapper" which maps semantic concepts to machine code, and if you know exactly which behaviour it needs to map you essentially understand the compiler as well.

So, let's get started!
