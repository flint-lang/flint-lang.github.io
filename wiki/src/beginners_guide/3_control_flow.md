# Control Flow

In the previous chapters, we learned the basics of printing to the console and working with variables and types in Flint. Now that we have a way to display information and store data, let's talk about how to control the flow of our program's execution. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of control flow in Flint.

## What is Control Flow?

Control flow refers to the order in which a program's statements are executed. In other words, it's the way a program decides what to do next. Control flow is essential in programming because it allows you to write programs that can make decisions, repeat tasks, and handle different situations.

## Why is Control Flow Important?

Control flow is crucial in programming because it enables you to:

- Write programs that can adapt to different inputs and situations
- Repeat tasks without having to write the same code multiple times
- Make decisions based on conditions and data

In this chapter, we will learn about the different control flow statements in Flint, including conditional statements, loops, and functions. We will see how to use these statements to write more efficient, readable, and effective programs.

## What to Expect

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

- Conditional statements: if, else, and switch
- Loops: for, while, and repeat
- Best practices for working with control flow statements

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of control flow in Flint, and you will be able to use it to write more sophisticated and efficient programs. Let's get started!
