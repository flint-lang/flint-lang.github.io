# Entities: Organizing Behavior and Data

<div class="warning">

Nothing from this chapter is implemented in the compiler

Absolutely everything regarding entities, func modules and links does not yet work in the current version of the Flint compiler. It will work eventually, but its quite a long yourney to get there still. So, everything that follows is the syntax and smenatics of how it **will** work, not how it **does** work.

</div>

Entities in Flint are central to its philosophy of combining **data** and **behavior** in a modular and flexible way. They are similar to classes in object-oriented languages but follow Flintâ€™s **Data-Object Convergence Paradigm (DOCP)**. Entities consist of **data modules** to store information and **func modules** to define behavior, providing a balance of structure and modularity.
