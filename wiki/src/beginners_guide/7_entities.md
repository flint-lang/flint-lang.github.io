# Entities: Organizing Behavior and Data

Entities in Flint are central to its philosophy of combining **data** and **behavior** in a modular and flexible way. They are similar to classes in object-oriented languages but follow Flintâ€™s **Data-Object Convergence Paradigm (DOCP)**. Entities consist of **data modules** to store information and **func modules** to define behavior, providing a balance of structure and modularity.
