# Enhanced for Loops

## Why Enhanced Loops?

Enhanced loops are simpler when iterating over collections, like arrays or ranges. They’re especially useful for focusing on elements instead of indices.

## Here’s the syntax:

```rs
for i, elem in 0..10:
    print($"Index {i}, Value {elem}");
```

i is the index (starts at -1).

elem is the current value.

Use enhanced loops when dealing with collections and ranges, but stick to normal loops for more complex conditions.
