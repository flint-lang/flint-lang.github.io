# Why Data?

Flint is centered around data, making it the heart of its paradigm, **Data-Object Convergence Paradigm (DOCP)**. In most programming languages, code revolves around objects or functions, but Flint is different—it places data at the center of everything. This design choice influences every aspect of the language.

## Why Focus on Data?

- **Data is Everything:** In real-world applications, data is what programs process, transform, and store. Focusing on data makes Flint naturally aligned with the goals of software development.
- **Simplicity and Modularity:** By emphasizing data structures, Flint avoids complex object hierarchies, instead favoring simple, modular components.
**Best of All Worlds:** Flint borrows strengths from other paradigms. From OOP, it takes the idea of encapsulated entities. From DOP, it inherits performance-centric, data-first design. Flint avoids the pitfalls of these paradigms by focusing on clear, maintainable, and efficient code.

## Why is This a Good Thing?

Flint’s focus on data ensures programs are modular, cache-efficient, and easy to reason about. It reduces unnecessary abstractions while retaining flexibility, making it an ideal language for applications like game development, simulations, and more.

## Enough Talk!

Now that you understand why data is so important, let’s dive into creating data structures in Flint. Shall we?
